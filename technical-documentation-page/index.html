			<p>This manual contains paraphrased information from <code></code><cite>The Anonymous Byzantine Treatise on Strategy</cite>, which contains postulates and theorems about how warfare should be conducted. The author is unknown, but it is possible that the author lived during the campaigns of the Roman general <em>Flavius Belisarius (500-565 C.E.)</em>, drawing his conclusions from Belisarius' reconquests of the former Western Roman territories.
			</p>
			
			<p>This manual is organized into five categories:
				<ol id="intro-contents">
					<li>Introduction</li>
					<li>Formation</li>
					<li>Equipment</li>
					<li>Deployment</li>
					<li>Leadership</li>

			<p>The <code></code> <strong>Phalanx</strong> is a formation of armed men designed to hold off an enemy, in a variety of shapes. It is usually an oblong or square formation. The soldiers in the 1st line are <dfn>protostatai </dfn> or "proto-states", and the 2nd line  are the <dfn>epistatai</dfn> or "epi-states". Each file is a <dfn>squad</dfn>, and its head a <dfn>squad leader</dfn>.
			2 squads form a <dfn>tetrarchy</dfn>, and its leader is a <dfn>tetrarch.</dfn> Two times that would be a <dfn>taxarchy</dfn>, led by a <dfn>taxarch</dfn>.	
			</p>

			<p>The frontline of the army should stand out, because of their courage and physical strength;they will need to handle the brunt of hand-to-hand engagements, while wearing heavy army. The second line should be similar to the 1st, and also be noticably superior to other soldiers, because they need to inspire the others to hold formation. They also keep the men ahead of them in close order so that they are stronger upon engagement with the enemy.</p>

				When troops are formed up, the front ranks should be equipped with heavy armor on the most exposed parts of the body. The shield should be at least <code></code><em>1 1/2 meters</em> in diameter to guard the man and nearby soldiers from incoming arrows. The chest armor and shin guard should ward off injury, but still be light enough to cause significant fatigue.
			</p>

			<p>A spear should be as long as a soldier can reasonably carry it when standing in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th line. When the phalanx is standing still, the distance should be about 2/3 of a meter. This is called the <dfn>Macedonian formation</dfn>.</p>

				The <code></code> file leaders, rear guards, 1st and 2nd lines, and other corresponding parts of a cavalry force should be equal in qualifications as the infantry force regarding bravery, physical strength, and experience or training. Their formation and equipment is similar. A <dfn>cavalry phalanx</dfn> is different than the infantry, being somewhat looser but is much more sudden in movement in a charge.
			</p>

			<p>
				With infantry and cavalry together, their are common scenarios which have common responses. <code></code>
				<ul>
					<li><em>More numbers, all else equal</em>: extend the battle line on one side to flank</li>
					<li><em>More numbers, and another advantage (equipment, experience, etc)</em>: attempt to flank on both sides in a <dfn>double envelopment.</dfn></li>
					<li>If the enemy attempts a double envelopment but you have equal numbers, then you should extend your lines to match the enemy to prevent their flanking manuever from working.</li>
					<li>If their army is more numerous, then your lines should not be extended.</li>
					<li>If they have infantry on their flanks, use infantry on your flanks.</li>
					<li>If they use cavalry on their flanks, put barricades or traps and skirmishers, such as archers, slingers, or javelinmen, on your flank. Have them open fire on the charging cavalry.</li>
					<li>Assuming all forces are relatively equal to the opponent, do not advance on the enemy until the enemy is put at a disadvantage, such as fatigue or bad weather.</li>
					<li>If the enemy is broken up into smaller groups, you can attempt to <dfn>defeat in detail</dfn> by charging the enemy with 3 soldiers to every 1 the enemy has, assuming equipment and experience are similar. This is how Flavius Belisarius was able to win most of his battles.</li>
				</ul>

			<p><code></code><dfn>Strategy</dfn> is a large scale plan to achieve a goal, such as the capture of enemy territory. <strong><dfn>Tactics</dfn></strong> enables one to organize and maneuver a body of armed personnel in an orderly manner.	
			</p>

			<p><code></code> Tactics may be divided into 4 parts.
				<ol id="tactics-4parts">
					<li>Proper organization of forces for combat</li>
					<li>Distribution of weapons according to needs</li>
					<li>Movement of troops appopriately to the occasion</li>
					<li>The management of war and personal materials, including ways and causes, as well as what is advantageous</li>
